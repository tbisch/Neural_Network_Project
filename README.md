## Overview

The 'StyleAligned' method is specifically crafted to address the challenge of inconsistent style within a set of images generated by Text to Image (T2I) models. This method introduces an innovative approach to enable the T2I model to generate outputs with a consistent style, eliminating the need for computationally expensive fine-tuning or manual intervention.

## Methodology

### Attention Sharing Between Reference and Target

The core of the 'StyleAligned' method lies in the meticulous attention sharing mechanism between a reference image and the rest of the generated set. The primary goal is to prevent content leakage while maintaining a coherent style across the output images.

1. **Single Reference Image:** Attention sharing is deliberately restricted to only one image in the generated set – the reference image. This strategic limitation ensures that the quality of the T2I model's results is preserved by preventing unwanted content leakage between the images.

2. **Feature Assignment:** Output image features are intelligently assigned to both themselves and the features of the designated reference image. This targeted feature assignment contributes to the creation of a diverse set of images that share a similar style.

3. **Balanced Attention Reference:** To further enhance style alignment between different images, the attention references (Qt and Kt of the target image) are normalized using Adaptive Normalization (AdaIN) based on the corresponding references from the reference image (Qr and Kr). This normalization process ensures a balanced attention reference, promoting a harmonized style across the entire set.

### Usage

We created the notebook in google colab, the free version is sufficient to run it. T4 GPU is necessary.
The notebook can be found in this repository.
